Establish Effective Learning Practices: Implement and maintain a disciplined approach to learning, including structured study, consistent practice, detailed progress logging via a learning journal, code documentation (comments, READMEs), and iterative refinement based on reflection and feedback.
4. Scope:

In Scope: Core programming concepts, Python and JavaScript language fundamentals, basic OOP principles, Git version control, development environment setup (VS Code), creation of small standalone applications/scripts, utilization of online learning resources and documentation, foundational algorithmic problem-solving, detailed personal progress tracking and reflection.
Out of Scope (for this initial project): Deep dives into specific frameworks (e.g., Django, React, Node.js), advanced algorithms and data structures, database management, network programming, large-scale application architecture, team-based collaboration dynamics (beyond basic Git workflows), formal software testing methodologies (beyond basic debugging).
5. Learning Methodology:

Project Genesis employs a blended learning approach:

Structured Learning: Utilizing reputable online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, freeCodeCamp), tutorials, and official documentation (Python Docs, MDN Web Docs) to grasp theoretical concepts.
Project-Based Learning: Reinforcing theoretical knowledge by immediately applying it to build tangible mini-projects.
Active Recall & Practice: Regularly solving coding challenges to strengthen problem-solving patterns and syntax recall.
Documentation & Reflection: Maintaining a detailed learning journal to track progress, obstacles, solutions, and insights. Writing clear code comments and project README files.
Community Engagement (Asynchronous): Leveraging resources like Stack Overflow and relevant forums for troubleshooting and understanding different perspectives (observational learning initially).
